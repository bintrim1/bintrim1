### ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Jordan

I am an aspiring Data Scientist with over 6 years of experience in healthcare EHR interoperability and a passion for leveraging data to solve complex problems. I recently completed an intensive Data Science program at TripleTen, where I honed my skills in Python, machine learning, and data analysis.

### ðŸŒŸ About Me

My journey in data science began with a strong foundation in Information Science and Technology from Pennsylvania State University. Over the years, I've developed a keen interest in the transformative power of data, particularly within the healthcare sector. My professional experience includes roles at Redox and Foundation Radiology Group, where I optimized data integrations, improved system performance, and facilitated seamless customer onboarding.

### ðŸš€ Skills and Technologies

    Programming Languages: Python, SQL
    Machine Learning Frameworks: Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
    Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
    Core Competencies: Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra, Data Analysis

### ðŸ’¼ Notable Projects
**[Churn Prevention Model](https://github.com/bintrim1/churn-prevention)**

Date: June 2024

In my final project at TripleTen, I developed a machine learning model to predict customer churn. By analyzing various models and maximizing the AUC-ROC, I delivered a final CatBoost model with an impressive 0.93 AUC-ROC. This project highlighted the top 5 factors influencing churn, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.

**[Taxi Ride Volume Forecasting](https://github.com/bintrim1/taxi-order-forecast)**

Date: May 2024

For this project, I utilized machine learning to predict the number of taxi orders in the next hour. By analyzing time series data for trends and seasonality, I developed and tuned a random forest model, achieving an RMSE of 47.4 rides. This model significantly improved the accuracy of ride volume predictions.
